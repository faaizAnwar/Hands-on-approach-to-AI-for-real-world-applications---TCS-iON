This Online Certificate Programme is offered by AI4ICPS of IIT Kharagpur in collaboration with TCS iON. AI4ICPS is an AI and ML Technology Innovation Hub established by the IIT Kharagpur.

The learners will acquire basic to intermediate level of proficiency in AI, with the help of industry and academic experts through live lectures and various hands-on tools used by the industry. Eligible learners will get minimum 3 interview opportunities. Also, all learners will get certificates basis on their performance. These certificates will be Certificate of Participation, Certificate of Completion and Certificate of Merit.

This course equips the learners to implement real world AI / ML algorithms hands-on using Python. Using a combination of Math, Python, and intuition, learners will practice Machine Learning problems and construct a mental model to understand how data scientists approach these problems programmatically. The course will also explore the inner workings of state-of-the-art AI applications like Generative AI (Natural Language Processing or NLP) and autonomous vehicles (Computer Vision).
